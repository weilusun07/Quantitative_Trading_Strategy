# Combining Strategy: Growth, Profitability, and Low Volatility

## Overview
This project is focused on constructing a stock portfolio based on a strategy that synergizes growth, profitability, and low volatility factors. By analyzing historical data from 1980 to 2023, the model is developed to outperform the market with reduced risk.

## Introduction
In this project, the quantitative investment strategy leverages historical data to create a diversified portfolio, aiming to balance growth and profitability while minimizing volatility.

## Quantitative Strategy
The strategy involves combining smart beta factors—growth, profitability, and volatility—to identify stocks with the potential for high returns, financial health, and stable performance.

## Data
Utilized datasets from CRSP for stock prices, COMPUSTAT for financial statements, and Fama-French Research Data for factor analysis. Data cleaning involved filtering for active stocks, handling missing values, and adjusting for splits and dividends.

## Implementation and Main Results
Backtesting the strategy from 1980 to 2012, it achieved an annual average return of 22.81%, with an excess return over the benchmark of 18.03%, and a Sharpe ratio of 1.09. The strategy’s annual volatility was comparatively low, demonstrating its effectiveness.

## Testing and Comparisons
The combined strategy shows some advantages in different perspectives compared to two-factor and single-factor models, providing a high risk-adjusted return which was evident from the increased alpha.
